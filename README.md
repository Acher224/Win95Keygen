## Windows 95 Key Generator

It is currently 1am, and I am bored. This is what I do for fun: code shitty programs.
Keys work on NT4, Win95, Office95, and prolly some other shit idunno.
Shoutouts to [this](https://medium.com/@dgurney/so-you-want-to-generate-license-keys-for-old-microsoft-products-a355c8bf5408) medium post for finding the algorithm in the NT4 source.

Warning: this shit may not work, like I said it's 1am and I'm too fucking lazy to test. Should work but if it doesn't fuck off.
